# bracelet-game
A cool game to design bracelets. There are two versions. The original one is the one I used and the new-version is the one I occasionally work on to make the game more asthetically pleasing.

# Bracelet Game:

Python program built with Pygame to help prototype bracelet designs. This tool was originally developed to assist in designing customizable bracelets for a Junior Achievement company.

# Features:

- Buttons to add beads
- Drag & Drop
- Clear Canvas
- Screenshot
– Trash bin bottom left (drag beads to delete)

# How It Works:

Each bead is a draggable circle. Users can freely move them around to create their ideal bracelet design. A "delete zone" (grey square) at the bottom of the screen to delete a controlled number of beads.

# Tech Used:

- Python 3
- Pygame

# Screenshots:

Use the "Screenshot" button in the app to save your layout as an image.

# Future Improvements:

- Add a bead color picker
- Export designs to a shareable format
- Web-based version (React or Canvas)
