A cool game to design bracelets

Bracelet Game:
Python program built with Pygame to help prototype bracelet designs. This tool was originally developed to assist in designing customizable bracelets for a Junior Achievement company.

Features:
- Buttons to add beads
- Drag & Drop
- Clear Canvas
- Screenshot
â€“ Trash bin bottom left (drag beads to delete)

How It Works:
Each bead is a draggable circle. Users can freely move them around to create their ideal bracelet design. A "delete zone" (grey square) at the bottom of the screen to delete a controlled number of beads.

Tech Used:
Python 3
Pygame

Screenshots:
Use the "Screenshot" button in the app to save your layout as an image.

Future Improvements:
-Add a bead color picker
-Export designs to a shareable format
-Web-based version (React or Canvas)

Why I Built This:
We needed a faster way to design bracelets for customers.
